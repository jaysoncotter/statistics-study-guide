# Statistics Study Guide & Flashcards

An interactive, browser-based study platform designed to help 
learners master core statistics concepts through multiple 
learning modalities.

## Features

- **📖 Study Guide** — Detailed topic coverage across 5 core areas 
  with formulas, key concepts, common pitfalls, and visual tables
- **🃏 Flashcards (37+)** — Interactive flip cards with category 
  filtering (Descriptive, Probability, Inference, Regression, 
  Study Design) and shuffle functionality
- **✏️ Practice Quiz (20 questions)** — Multiple choice with 
  immediate feedback, explanations, progress tracking, and scoring
- **📋 Cheat Sheet** — Quick-reference grid of formulas, rules, 
  and common misconceptions

## Topics Covered

- Descriptive Statistics (central tendency, spread, distributions)
- Probability (Bayes' theorem, distributions, independence)
- Inferential Statistics (CLT, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)
- Regression & Correlation (R², assumptions, residuals)
- Study Design (sampling methods, experimental vs. observational)

## Background

I build interactive study guides to help people learn complex 
material through active recall, self-testing, and multiple 
learning formats. This platform demonstrates how dense 
conceptual material can be restructured into concise, testable 
Q&A pairs while also supporting different study preferences — 
cards for active recall, quizzes for self-assessment, guides 
for deep reading, and cheat sheets for quick reference.

## Tech

Single-page HTML/CSS/JavaScript — no frameworks, no 
dependencies. Just open `index.html` in any browser.
